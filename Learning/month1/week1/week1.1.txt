Image File Formats (Estimated time: 1-2 hours)

Concept: Standardized ways to organize and store digital image data. They often involve compression to reduce file size.
Common Formats:
JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg):
Lossy compression: Discards some image data to achieve smaller file sizes. Good for photographs.
You can often choose the compression level (quality). Higher compression means smaller file but more data loss.
PNG (.png):
Lossless compression: No image data is lost. File sizes are generally larger than JPEGs for photos but can be smaller for images with large areas of flat color (like graphics or screenshots).
Supports an alpha channel for transparency.
GIF (.gif):
Lossless for images with up to 256 distinct colors. Supports simple animations.
TIFF (.tif, .tiff):
Flexible, can be lossless or lossy. Supports multiple layers. Common in medical imaging and professional photography/printing.
BMP (.bmp):
Often uncompressed or uses simple lossless compression. Results in large files.
Key Takeaway for Now: You'll mostly work with JPEGs and PNGs. The library you use (like OpenCV) will handle the details of reading these formats.
Action/Learning Resources:
Find an image on your computer. Try saving it as a JPEG (with varying quality settings if your software allows) and as a PNG. Compare file sizes and look closely for any quality differences.
